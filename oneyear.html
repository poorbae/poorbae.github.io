            looking back at the time i had with you, it makes me emotional. <br>
            
            it makes me both happy and sad as fuck.<br>
            
            i wish we could spend more time together irl. or any time actually. <br>

        </div>this is literally me inside everytime i see your face.<br>
        bae, you're the best. <br>
        i literally want to spend my life with you and nobody else.<br>
        nobody makes me feel the way you do, i don't think anybody is even capable.<br>
        you're the best. i love you so much.<br>
        i hope we're LIVING together by the time our next year anniversary comes. <br>
        and i hope, you get whatever you want from life.<br>
        i honestly pray everyday that you're happy bae.<br>
        i know you miss me and i know it affects you.<br>
        because it affects me too.<br>
        but i want you to be happy always.<br>
        i'm sure you'll do good in your exams love, there's no need to worry.<br>
        seeing you study everyday honestly has motivated ME so much.<br>
        anyway not to bore you, just saying i love you. i love you so so so much.<br>
        and i miss you.<br>
        i wanna meet you soon.<br>
        our first year together was beautiful. but it wasn't fulfilling. <br>
        because i know how it feels to be with you<br>
        and i'll only be happy on an anniversary when we actually spend one year TOGETHER IRL<br>
        (not saying that i'm sad now, i'm grateful you're with me)<br><br>
        thank you so much for everything. thank you for keeping up with me,<br>
        when i made it so hard to.<br>
        thank you so much for being there for me everyday.<br>
        even when you weren't doing good.<br>
        thank you so much. like literally  for everything.<br>
        you're the best.<br><br>
