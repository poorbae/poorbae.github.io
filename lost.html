            hey bae. <br>

            just typed this to let you know.. everything is gonna be okay <br>
            
            i know and understand how it must feel to be in your place. you’re feeling lost and confused about what to do. <br>
            
            honestly, i get it. anyone in your place would feel this way. <br>
            
            and you know what? it’s totally okay to feel that way. <br>
            
            i know you are going to do good. in life. and <br>
            
            i’m not just saying this for the sake of it. i mean it. <br>
            
            you’re amazing. you’ll figure yourself out soon enough <br>
            
            and tbh it doesn’t even matter what you do. <br>
            
            because i know for a fact you can ace anything you put your mind to. <br>
            
            you really can. <br>
            
            i know for a fact you will be looking back at this time, looking back at this page<br>
            
            and thinking that you made the right decision, whatever decision you make. <br><br>
            
            you’re destined to have an amazing life poorbi. and no one can come in your way <br>and prevent that from happening. <br>
            
            i love you, and honestly i have learned so much from you. <br>
            
            you’re just the best. something about you is so magical, i cannot explain it. <br>
            
            also fuck upsc if you don’t want to do it. but don’t think that you gave up. ever. <br>
            
            you could’ve easily been able to do it. this was your first time and honestly?<br>
            
            i’m proud of you for working so hard. <br>
            
            but, if you really don’t want to wait until next year and waste all this time, then yes!<br>
            
            just leave it. maybe it’s not meant to be. better things await you. <br>
            
            <br>
            
            my whole point of writing this is, to tell you, to make you realise <br>
            
            just how amazing and smart you are. you know that too. i know you know. <br>
            
            i just feel like you being so sad about things right now is affecting you in a bad way. <br>
            
            and that might make you not want to make a decision. <br>
            
            listen. 
            
            just don’t be too harsh on yourself please. you overthink and overanalyze everything. <br>
            
            you should learn to take it easy. and think acche se calm hoke. <br>
            
            everything that’s gonna happen is gonna happen for a good reason. <br>
            
            just put your heart to it, which i know you will. <br>
            
            i know you can do it. whatever decision you make,<br>
            
            i know it’ll be the right one. and i’ll always be there w you, for you. <br>
            
            i’ll support you no matter what, no matter where. okay. <br>
            
            you’re not alone in this. you got this. we got this. <br>
            
            i love you. yours always.
