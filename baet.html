        hey baby<br>

happy birthday. happy 22. i love you so much. <br>

can’t believe it’s almost an year since we’ve been together.<br>

it feels unreal. <br>

makes me happy, and at the same time, breaks my heart. <br>

it breaks my heart because, we should’ve been together more. <br>

and i know, you probably think it could’ve been possible if i had tried harder. <br>

but trust me, i tried my best to come to you. <br>

i have missed you every day you were 21. <br>

and i’ll miss you every day you’ll be 22. <br>

i love you a lot. <br><br>

i know have made  a lot of mistakes throughout,<br>and i regret doing a lot of things. <br>

i’m just glad you’re still mine.  <br>

i’m glad that i fought for our relationship when i did,<br>

and i’m grateful that you fought for our relationship when i didn’t. <br>

i’m genuinely sorry for hurting you ever and i hope you can forgive me. <br>

moving forward i promise to be more considerate towards your feelings,<br>

and i’ll try harder to understand the things you can’t say. <br>

i’ll try harder everyday to come to you. <br>

honestly, i don’t even have a problem because? <br>i want to do all this<br>

i have been trying everyday to be better. <br>

i’m sorry for those couple of months i was so detached,<br>from everything. <br>

it was just a bad phase in my personal life,<br>

and i know you didn’t deserve the way you were treated. <br><br>

i love you a lot. <br>

i pray everyday but i pray, that this year brings out the best things for you.<br>

i know what you’ve been through in your 21<br>

things have been hard for you, <br>

you’ve felt down at multiple times. <br>

i know you think that there’s nothing to look forward to, <br>

but there is. <br>

i’ve seen you, talked to you everyday. <br>

and i’m <b><i>actually</i></b> so proud of you.<br>

you’ve made it out of hard situations. <br>

you’ve helped me get out of hard situations. <br>

you’ve helped me get a better look at the world. <br>

being with you made me a better human. <br>

it makes me a better human everyday, <br>

i love you so much, for being yourself. <br>

you’re really strong. <br>

and i know, you can achieve anything you put your mind to. 

<br><br>

just know that i’ll always be behind you,<br>

watching your back, no matter what. <br>

you don’t need anyone to, but just in case. <br>

i love you a lot. <br>

i love you the most. <br>

more than anyone has ever loved anyone. <br>

thank you so much for everything you’ve given.<br>

thank you so much for everything you’ve done. <br>

i’ll forever be grateful. <br>

let’s meet soon. <br>

<br>
